Overall :  
    ; Generic datas : Remove the parts where 2D stuff is forced on
    ; debug_assertion error while deleting the allocated memory of objects created on params
    ; simplify everything use basic data-types to later on migrate to C

LongTerm :
    ; Convert to data oriented mode
    ; Implement UI using IMGUI
    ; Convert everything to be compatible with the Grand - {C}
